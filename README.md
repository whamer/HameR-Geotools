# HameR-Geotools
R-scripts making geoprocessing tools from R ready to use in QGIS

Before you can use the tools you need to:

1. [Install R](https://www.r-project.org/)
2. [Implement](https://docs.qgis.org/3.10/en/docs/user_manual/plugins/plugins.html) the QGIS Plugin [Processing R Provider](https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/processing_r/)
3. Either create a new R-Tool and copy the content of the tool or copy the .rsx-file to the correct folder.
4. Install the R libraries used in the tool in the R environment
5. Use the tool in Python
